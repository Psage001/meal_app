# **Meal App** üç≤

**Meal App** is a Flutter-based mobile application that allows users to browse, filter, select, and favorite meals. With a sleek user interface and easy navigation, this app provides a seamless experience for users looking to explore new recipes. Users can filter meals based on preferences like dietary restrictions, complexity, and more.

This app was inspired by a Flutter course I took on **Udemy**, which helped shape many of the features and the overall structure of the app.
